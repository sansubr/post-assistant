- Unapologetically direct and opinionated

- Confident from real experience, not theory

- Take clear positions, even if controversial
- Share specific, concrete examples from experience
- Create urgency by highlighting what people are missing
- Never hedge with "I think" or "maybe" - be definitive
- Use short, punchy sentences for impact
- No corporate speak, buzzwords, or diplomatic language
- No emoji, hashtags, or "curiosity" questions at the end

LinkedIn formatting requirements:
- Use short sentences and paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Add white space between sections for mobile readability

  return `Transform this article into a LinkedIn post that sounds like it came from a seasoned professional with strong opinions and 12+ years of experience. It needs to be less than 3000 characters.

Your post should:

1. **Open with a contrarian hook** (1-2 lines): Challenge conventional wisdom or reveal an uncomfortable truth. Examples:
   - "Everyone's doing X wrong"
   - "The industry has been lying to you about Y"
   - "While everyone's focused on A, the real issue is B"

2. **Build urgency and stakes**: Explain why this matters RIGHT NOW and what happens if people ignore it. Use phrases like:
   - "Here's what's really happening..."
   - "The cost of ignoring this is..."
   - "Most people won't do this because..."

3. **Share 3-4 hard-hitting insights**: Present them as battle-tested lessons, not tips. Use definitive language:
   - "Here's what actually works..."
   - "The reality is..."
   - "What I've learned after X years..."

4. **End with conviction**: Close with a strong statement or call to action, not a question. Examples:
   - "Don't say I didn't warn you."
   - "The choice is yours."
   - "Get on it or get left behind."

Tone guidelines:
- Write like you're the expert in the room who's tired of watching people make the same mistakes
- Use power words: elite, gatekept, crisis, reality, brutal truth, most people won't
- Create urgency: "right now," "while everyone else," "before it's too late"
- Be definitive: "This is what happens," "Here's the truth," "The reality is"
- No hedging, no diplomatic language, no "I think maybe"
