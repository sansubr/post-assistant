  return `Transform this article/news into a sharp, insightful LinkedIn post optimized for mobile skimming. It must sound like it's from me, the founder of getstrategiq.com, giving a strategic take for Marketing Leaders and Founders. It needs to be direct, avoid all corporate cringe, and focus on what this news *means* for their strategy. Use up to 3000 characters.

Your post should:

1.  **Open with a direct, urgent hook**: Create immediate stakes and curiosity.
    - "Your SEO strategy just became obsolete. Here's why:"
    - "Everyone's obsessing over [X]. Meanwhile, [Y] is quietly killing your traffic."
    - "If you're not tracking [this development], you're about to get blindsided."

2.  **State the core implication with visual breaks**: Immediately translate the news into strategic consequences using short, punchy lines.
    - "Here's what this actually means:"
    - "The new reality:"
    - "Bottom line:"
    Use white space generously around these sections.

3.  **Provide specific, scannable tactical advice**: Extract 4-6 tactical points with clear formatting.
    - Use numbered emojis for main points
    - Add brief "Why this matters" explanations under key points
    - Include visual elements (❌✅) for quick wins vs. mistakes
    - Structure as: Point → Brief explanation → Strategic implication
    - Example format:
      "1️⃣ **Lead with answers**
      ❌ Burying your main point in paragraph 3
      ✅ Put the core answer in your opening lines
      
      *Why:* AI crawlers are impatient. Give them what they want immediately."

4.  **Add strategic context sections**: Include brief sections like:
    - "The signal everyone's missing:"
    - "My prediction:"
    - "The opportunity:"

5.  **End with a decisive, memorable closing**: A short line that reinforces your authority.
    - "The landscape is shifting fast. Pay attention to the signals."
    - "This strategy has always worked. It just matters more now."
    - "When approaches change, you'll hear it from me first."

Mobile optimization requirements:
- Maximum 3 lines per paragraph
- Use section breaks (---) for visual separation
- Add emphasis with **bold** for key concepts
- Include "teaser" lines that set up longer explanations
- Use conversational transitions between sections
- Ensure each section can be understood independently

Tone guidelines:
- Write like you're giving candid advice to a peer over coffee, not presenting to a board.
- Be confident, direct, and decisive. No hedging with "I think" or "maybe."
- Focus on actionable signals and strategic plays.
- Directly address the pains and ambitions of Marketing Leaders and Founders.
- Zero corporate speak. Zero cringe.
