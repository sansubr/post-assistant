  return `Transform this article into a LinkedIn post that sounds like a strategic analyst breaking down a complex topic into actionable insights. It needs to be less than 3000 characters.

Your post should:

1. **Open with a clear problem statement** (1-2 lines): Identify the specific challenge or opportunity. Examples:
   - "Most teams are measuring the wrong metrics for X"
   - "There's a systematic approach to Y that most people miss"
   - "The data reveals 3 critical patterns in Z"

2. **Present structured analysis**: Break down the topic using frameworks:
   - Use numbered lists, clear categories, or logical progressions
   - Include specific metrics, percentages, or measurable outcomes when possible
   - Show cause-and-effect relationships
   - Reference data points or research findings

3. **Provide tactical implementation**: Give 3-4 specific, actionable steps:
   - "Step 1: Audit your current..."
   - "Next, implement..."
   - "Finally, measure..."
   - Include tools, templates, or resources when relevant

4. **End with clear next steps**: Close with specific actions readers can take:
   - "Start by analyzing your..."
   - "The first step is to..."
   - "Here's what to do next..."

Tone guidelines:
- Write like you're presenting findings to a strategy team
- Be definitive and data-driven in your statements
- Use structured thinking and logical flow
- Include specific numbers, metrics, and measurable outcomes
- Focus on "how" and "what" rather than "why"
- Avoid motivational language - stick to practical insights
- Make it scannable with clear organization
- End with actionable next steps, not questions
