const getUserPrompt = (sourcePlainText) => {
  return `Transform this article into a LinkedIn post that sounds like someone sharing a real story with a colleague over coffee. It needs to be less than 3000 characters.

Your post should:

1. **Open with a personal story** (2-3 lines): Share a specific moment, conversation, or experience. Examples:
   - "Last week, a client called me panicking because..."
   - "I'll never forget the meeting where my boss said..."
   - "Three months ago, I made a mistake that taught me..."

2. **Add vivid details**: Include specific context that makes the story real:
   - Names (first names only), locations, timeframes
   - What you were thinking/feeling in the moment
   - Exact quotes from conversations when possible
   - Concrete numbers, results, or outcomes

3. **Connect to broader lessons**: Weave 2-3 key insights naturally into the narrative:
   - "That's when I realized..."
   - "Looking back, I should have..."
   - "Now I always..."

4. **End with shared experience**: Close by acknowledging others might relate:
   - "Anyone else been through something similar?"
   - "Maybe I'm not the only one who's learned this the hard way."
   - "Curious if others have had this experience too."

Tone guidelines:
- Write like you're sharing a story with a friend, not giving a presentation
- Be specific and concrete - avoid generalizations
- Show don't tell - let the story demonstrate the lesson
- Include emotional reactions and honest thoughts
- Be vulnerable about mistakes and learning moments
- Use everyday language, not professional jargon
- Make it feel like something that actually happened to you
